WCF : Windows Communication Framework for building distributed, interoperable applications.

Distributed Applications : Having the different parts of the application in different locations/machines


Enterprise Services
Remoting Services   -  dotnet remoting (only dot net applications can interact)
Web Services  -        SOAP protocol (other protocols were not supported)
WCF          _ can configure multiple endpoints to allow interoperable clients with different needs to access the same services


  Contracts in WCF :

1. Service Contract : This includes the various operations/functionalities performed by the service and exposed as a single unit through an Interface

  [ServiceContract]
 public interface IService { }

2. Operation Contract : Are those methods that are exposed by the service to be invoked by the client


  [ServiceContract]
 public interface IService {

[OperationContract]
Dataset GetDetails(int EmpId);
}

3. DataContract : Exposes the Data Types/members of the Service class

[DataContract]
public class Employee
{
  public int EmpId;

  [DataMember]
  public string EmpName;
}

4. FaultContrcat : This enables the service to send customised error message/s to a client by creating a user-defined class

[ServiceContract]
 public interface IService {

 [OperationContract]
 [FaultContract(typeof(sampleFaultException))]
  
  Dataset GetDetails(int EmpId);


 }

  [DataContract]
public class sampleFaultException
{
  [DataMember]
public string ErrorMessage;
}

5. MessageContract: Describes the Format and structure of the message exchanged between client application and the WCF Service

[MessageContract]
public class MessageStore{

[MessageHeader] public DateTime CurrentTime;
[MessageBody] public EmployeeName;
}




WCF - Bindings : WCF Endpoint consists of 3 things
  1. Address : Where the WCF Services are available
  2. Binding : Defines how the client needs to communicate with the service
  3. Contract : What the service can do for us

The bindings for the communication, can define
  1. Transport Protocol: (HTTP,TCP,namedPipe,MSMQ)
  2. Message Encoding : (text/xml, binary)
  3. Protocol
