EF :  Entity Framework

- There are 3 approaches to work with the EF

  1. Database first : Database is already existing
  2. Code first : No Database, we have to create it using the objects(classes)
  3. Model First : No Database/NoCode ( we create a design


Life Cycle of EF 

 1. Added
 2. Modified
 3. Deleted
 4. Detached
 5. Unchanged


The namespace System.Data.Entity contains classes that provides access to the core functionality of the EF
It enables to perform CRUD using CLR strongly typed objects

 Types of Entities:

 1. POCO Entities ( Plain Old CLR Object) : A POCO entity is a class that does not depend on any framework specific base classes. It is like any other normal .NET CLR class

 2. Dynamic Proxy Entities(POCO Proxy) : Is a runtime proxy class which wraps POCO entity. This allows lazy loading

EF Context : Is a class that represents the entire Database Schema as  domain specific objects. These Objects are represented as DBSets

DBSet: is a collection of all entity related information that can be queried/ or manipulated to effect the original source


CRUD :
To pass data from view to controller, we can use the below 4 ways
 1. Model Object 
 2. Passing as parameters
 3. Request Object
 4. Forms Collection
