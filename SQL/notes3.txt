Identity Columns : Are applied to numeric data types. Does not allow data entry into the identity column, instead
will automatically genererate a sequence and enters the data


table 1
  col1 dt1 not null 
  col2 dt2 null 
  col3 dt3  not null
  col4 dt4 default 'aaa'

inserrt into table 1 values(c1,null,c3)

insert into table 1(col1,col3) values(c1,c3)

c1    null    c3    aaa



Delete                      vs                                Truncate

DMLCommand (retains the last identity value)		DDL Command (not able to retain the last generated identity value)
We can restrict no.of rows to be deleted			Cannot restrict no of rows to be deleted
It is slower than truncate						It is faster
We can retrieve the deleted rows using rollback		Cannot be rolled back


Transactions : A smallest unit of work managed with the help of ACID properties

A - Atomicity - (all statements inside a transaction should either succeed or fail as a unit
C - Consistency - (Either the changes are reflected in the database or no changes are reflected)   
I - Isolation - (Eg/ until the  First Transaction either commits or rollsback, the second transaction cannot perform any dml, only selection is possible)
D - Durability - (safeguarding the committed data)

Transaction Modes:

1. Auto-commit Transaction : Is a default mode, that evaluates every statement as a transaction and commits if succesfull or rollback if unsuccessful (permissions, object names, syntax)

2. Implicit Transaction : SQL server will begin the transaction internally and wait for either a commit or rollback 
       set implicit_transactions on|off
3. Explicit Transacations : We have to define the starting and ending points of the transactions

   Begin Transaction
     sql statements 1
    "   "      "   2
    "     "     "  3
   Commit | Rollback   (end of the transaction)

Note : A transaction begins when the first DML statement is executed
       Ends with one of the following
         - A commit or rollback
         - A DDL or a DCL statement is executed(auto commit)
         - The user exits
         - The System Crashes

Transaction mamanegement ensures
  - Data Consistency
  - Preview data changes before making the changes permanent
  - Group logically related operations into one unit

Save Transactions : Are logical blocks/markers of a set of operations in a transaction
                    It is not an ANSI standard SQL
        

Transact Sql (T-SQL)
    - Ability of the database to help in writing small/ medium functionalities(coding)
    - If else
    - case
    - Loops
    - Exceptions

- Variables : are of 2 types
  1. Local Variable - @
  2. Global Variable - @@
