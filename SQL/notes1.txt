DBMS : Database Management System : A set of programs to access the data.
- An environment that is both convenient and efficient to use.

Why DBMS? : Draw Backs of File System
 - Data Redundancy and inconsistency
 - Difficulty in accessing data
 - Data Isolation - multiple files and formats
 - Integrity problems
 - Concurrency problems
 - Security (giving access partially or fully to select few employees)

Few RDBMS Databases in the market : Oracle, MSSql, Postgress, Informix, Sybase, MySql

Architecture of DBMS : 3 level arch.
1. Physical level : Binary format(1/0)
2. Logical level : describes data stored in a database along with the relationships of the data in a table/matrix format (rows/columns)
3. Application/View Level

Data Models : A collection if tools for describing
 - Data
 - Data Relationships
 - Data Semantics
 - Data Constraints

Types of Models:
 1. HDBMS : Hierarchial Database Management System
 2. NDBMS - Network Database Management System
 3. RDBMS : Relational Database Management System
 4. ORDBMS : Object Relational Database Management System (Multimedia, Hypertext based databases)
