--Triggers
--eg 1 basic triggers
create or alter trigger trg_InsertEmp
on Employee
for Insert
as
begin
 select * from inserted  -- to show the magic tables having the data
 select * from employee
end

--the execution of the above trigger happens automatically whenever we insert a record/s into
-- the employee table on which the trigger is created
insert into employee values(201,'Rekha','Female',36000,'2020/01/05',6,'655555')

--eg 2
create trigger trg_updateEmp
on employee
for update
as
begin
  select * from deleted
  select * from inserted
end

update employee set salary=45000 where empid=200

--eg - triggers that log the details
--first let us create an audit table to have the log details
create table EmpAudit
(msg nvarchar(max))

--1. let us write an insert trigger on employee to log the details
--drop trigger trg_AuditLog
create or alter trigger trg_AuditLogInsert
on employee
for insert
as
begin
 declare @id int
 select @id=empid from inserted
 insert into EmpAudit values('New Employee with EmpId: ' + cast(@id as nvarchar(10)) +
 ' is added at :' + cast(getdate() as nvarchar(20)))
end

-- 2. same as above, we shall write one delete trigger
create or alter trigger trg_AuditLogDelete
on employee
for delete
as
begin
 declare @id int
 select @id=empid from deleted
 insert into EmpAudit values('An Existing Employee with EmpId: ' + cast(@id as nvarchar(10)) +
 ' is deleted at :' + cast(getdate() as nvarchar(20)))
end

insert into employee values(300,'Mahesh','Male',40000,'2020/11/11',5,99887766)

select * from employee
select * from EmpAudit

delete from employee where empid=300

--Instead of Triggers
--lets us understand instead of triggers (are fired instead of the actual DML Operations)
--so lets create a view to understand instead of triggers
create or alter view vWEmployeeDetails
as
select empid,empname,salary,phoneno,department.DeptName from employee join department on
employee.Deptid=Department.Deptid

--if we try to insert a record through the above view we get an error of multiple base tables
select * from vWEmployeeDetails

insert into vWEmployeeDetails values(12,'Testdata2',50000,'000003','Testing')
select * from Department
--How to overcome the problem ?
drop trigger trg_vWemployeeDetails_InsteadOf
create trigger trg_vWemployeeDetails_InsteadOf
on vWEmployeeDetails
instead of insert
as
begin
 declare @departmentid int
 --first let us check if there is a valid department in the department table 
 -- for a given department name
 select @departmentid=Department.deptid from department join inserted i on 
 i.deptname=Department.deptname
 --if departmentid is null, then throw an error
 if(@departmentid is null)
  begin
   Raiserror('Inavlid Department. statement terminated', 16,1)
   return
  end

  --finally if everything is ok, then let us insert into employee table
  insert into employee(Empid,Empname,Salary,Phoneno,deptid)
  select Empid,Empname,Salary,phoneno,@departmentid from inserted
