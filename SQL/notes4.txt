Views : Virtual Tables that contain only the view definition (query expression) and not the data
        
Benefits : Security
           Hiding some sensitive information
           Easier access to few columns from various tables in a repeated query
           Executing a View like a table

The view expression is substituted into a query and executed by the Sql engine

Stored Procedure: stored set of valid sql statements
                  provides reusability
                  Stores the query execution plan along with the statements



Syntax: create procedure <procedure name>
     as
      begin
       dml/dql statements
       transactions
       error handlers
       end
-- Can take input parameters
   Can give output parameters
   Always returns an integer

int add(int a, int b)


Functions : stored sql statements, that can be reused
,
1. A function must return a value whereas a procedure need not 
2. A procedure can have both input and output parameters, where as functions have only input parameters
3. In procedures, we can perform select, insert,delete, update operations, wherea s functions can be used only for select command operations. Cannot be used for data manipulation in the table
4. A procedure provides the options for transaction management, error handling etc, but in functions , we cannot
5. We call aprocedure using Execute/Exec command where as function is called using select command
6. From a procedure, we can call other procedures, and functions, but from a function, we can only call other functions
7. UDF can be used in select/having clauses, but procedures cannot be used

Table valued Functions : Unlike Scalar Functions, Returns more data with the return type marked as table 
                         Does not allow Begin and  end clause
