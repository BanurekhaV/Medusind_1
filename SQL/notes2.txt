Relational Algebra - Set theory

Selection/Restriction - where
Projection - col list

Count - ignores null
Count * - includes null

sorting data  using order by
some imp. points : 1. We can sort on multiple columns
                   2. we can sort on an alias column
                   3. we can sort on a column that is not in the select list


Group by : 1. All columns apart from aggregates have to be included in the group by clause
           2. We cannot group on an alias column 
           3. We can group by multiple columns, provided they are included in the select list and also the columns are groupable

--The order of Select query 

select list of columns
from table names
where
group by col name/s 
having condition
order by

The order of execution of a select query

1. from 
2. where
3. group by
4. having
5. order by
6. select

Differences between where clause and having clause

Where								Having
- is applied on individual rows			is applied on individual groups
- restricts no. of rows					restricts number of groups
- executed before formation of groups		executed after formation of groups
