Points to remember :
IL(intermediate Lang.) is also called as MSIL,CIL or Managed Code
Assemblies get created on compiling a source code. 
Assemblies are of 2 types(.exe or .dll) depending on the type of application
Source code ---Compiles --- IL\
IL -- compiles on JIT (Just in Time)Compilation--Platform specific native code

What is an Assembly ?


- They are fundamental unit of deployment, version control,reuse and security of a ,net application
- They contain PE Header(portable executable), CLR header, Manifest File and IL
- Manifest files contain MetaData (data about Data)
- Assemblies can be private or shared
- Shared assemblies are placed in GAC (Global Assembly Cache)

Tools(.exe file) that help in manipulating assembly file and reassembling the IL

   ILDASM (IL disassembler)
