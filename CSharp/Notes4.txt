Types of classes :

1. static class : cannot be inherited and cannot be instantiated. All memebers have to be static. Eg :static class mystaticclass{  }

2. abstract class: Cannot be instantiated, but have to be inherited. The subclasses(child/derived) can either implement or override its method. 

abstract method: are methods that have only declarations and no definitions (body/implementation/code)

Abstract classes:  are classes that can have both abstract as well as non-abstract members.

Eg : abstract class myabstractclass {   }

3. partial class :Can be defined in multiple Files. Multiple developers can work simultaneously with the class. Eg :public partial class mypartialclass {   }

4. sealed class : cannot be inherited, but can be instantiated. They are concrete classes. Eg : sealed class mysealedclass { }


Interfaces : are like classes, which can contain properties,methods,delegates,events etc, but only have declarations and no implementation
- Interface members are public by default, you cannot modify the access
- They cannot be instantiated, but a reference object can point to a derived class
- They have to be inherited
- A class can inherit from multiple interfaces
- A class that inherits from an interface, will have to provide implementation to all the methods
- Interfaces can inherit from other interface
Eg : interface1{ method1(); method2();}

     interface2{ method3(); method4();}
    
     interface3:interface1,interface2 { method5();}

class a:interface3
{

method1(){}
method2(){}
method3(){}
method4(){}
method5(){}
}
